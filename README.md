- **JavaScript**: Deepened understanding of code structuring and implementation of complex logic.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Gained expertise in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the user interface.
- **Data Management**: Organized and managed data structures for storing questions and answers efficiently.
- **DOM Templates and Cloning**: Applied techniques for template creation and node cloning to streamline content generation.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners to handle user interactions and enhance the quiz experience.
- **Sets for Unique Data**: Utilized Sets to manage and ensure uniqueness of data elements within the application.
- **Programming Best Practices**: Followed best practices to ensure code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
